# Pathfinding-visualizer
A data structures project as part of CSE2003-Data structures and Algorithms course in VIT Chennai. This project is based on various shortest path algorithms that are visualized with the help of HTML and JS.

# Algorithms used
<li> Greedy Algorithm
<li> A* algorithm
<li> Dijkstra's Algorithm
  
# Procedure
To Run the code, open index.html<br>
By default, the code runs dijkstra's algorithm. To run others, comment the rest accordingly.
